# autoGrader
Automatically grade sas, R, Rmd, and py files

This is a python3 app using tkinter for the GUI which takes a set of files (perhaps from a Course Management System) representing submitted homework, and runs each file in a sandbox.  The input and the output are analyzed according to the criteria in the configuration files (one for each file to be submitted).
